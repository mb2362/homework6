'''

This Python code defines a Calculator class that provides a simple interface for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on Decimal numbers. The class uses static methods, demonstrating a functional approach within an object-oriented context. 
Each operation method creates a Calculation object, performs the calculation, adds it to a history of calculations, and then returns the result. 
This code demonstrates effective use of object-oriented and functional programming principles to create a modular, maintainable, and easy-to-use calculator interface.
